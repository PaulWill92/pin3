Project 3 - statistical inference's using T and Anova tests

Team members: Paul, Isabel, Naweed

Project goal: Find a data set (ask a question), create H0 and H1 hypotheses, determine our sample size, establish our significance value (alpha),  run a few T tests, determine if our questions pose statistical significance, if they do ask if we can derive something meaningful from them, if we get a false positive or a high p value ask why based on our variables, and  run a regression (for fun).

Project approach: Decide on our data, explore possible variables, create multiple sample sets, graph them to see the central limit theorem in action.
